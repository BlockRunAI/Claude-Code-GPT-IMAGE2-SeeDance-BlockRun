# `/dance` — Image-to-dance-video in one command

Drop a photo of a person, pick a dance style, get back a clean 5-second
mp4 (plus a shareable looping gif). Powered by ByteDance Seedance 2.0
through the BlockRun x402 gateway.

## What this skill does

Calls `mcp__blockrun__blockrun_video` with `image_url` set to the user's
photo, `model="bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast"`, and a choreography prompt
from the **Dance style variants** section at the bottom of this file.
The MCP tool blocks while polling internally for 60–180 seconds, then
returns a permanent mp4 URL. The skill downloads the mp4 to
`./blockrun-out/{ts}-dance/dance.mp4` and renders a GIF preview.

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `image` (path or URL) | yes | — | Photo of the person. Full body or 3/4 body works best. |
| `style` | no | `tiktok-trend` | `hiphop`, `ballet`, `contemporary`, `kpop`, `terracotta-disco`, `tiktok-trend`, `freestyle-from-music`. |
| `music` | no | — | Free text. Only used when `style=freestyle-from-music`. |
| `duration_seconds` | no | `5` | Range 1–10. Seedance 2.0-fast charges $0.15/sec. |
| `output_dir` | no | `./blockrun-out/{ts}-dance/` | Override with `BLOCKRUN_OUT_DIR`. |

If the user says "make a dance video" without a photo, ask for the photo path.

## Workflow (Claude executes strictly in order)

### Step 0 — Verify the BlockRun MCP server is registered

Before any tool call, confirm `mcp__blockrun__blockrun_video` and
`mcp__blockrun__blockrun_wallet` are available. If not, surface this
exact message and stop:

> "The BlockRun MCP server isn't registered with Claude Code yet, so
> `/dance` can't run. Please run **once**:
>
> ```
> claude mcp add blockrun -s user -- npx -y @blockrun/mcp@latest
> ```
>
> Then restart Claude Code and try `/dance` again. (Full install
> guide: `INSTALL.md` in the Claude Code-GPT-IMAGE2-SeeDance-BlockRun bundle.)"

Do not proceed to the wallet preflight or video call if the MCP tools
are missing.

### Step 1 — Wallet preflight

Call `mcp__blockrun__blockrun_wallet` with `{"action": "status"}`.

- Required balance: `0.15 × duration_seconds` USDC plus a small buffer.
  For default 5s, require **≥ $1.00 USDC**.
- If too low, pause and tell the user:
  > "Your BlockRun wallet balance is too low. /dance with 5s Seedance 2.0-fast
  > costs ~$0.75. Run `blockrun_wallet action: setup` to top up Base USDC."
  Do not proceed.

### Step 2 — Image accessibility

The Seedance image-to-video flow needs a publicly fetchable URL or the MCP
tool will accept a hosted image. The current MCP `blockrun_video` tool's
`image_url` parameter expects a URL.

- If the user gave a URL: pass through.
- If the user gave a local file path:
  1. Verify the file exists with `Read`.
  2. Confirm size < 10 MB and dimensions are reasonable (Seedance prefers
     ≥ 720px on the short side).
  3. **Local-file fallback:** Use `mcp__blockrun__blockrun_image` with
     `action="edit"` and a no-op-style prompt
     (e.g. `"return the image unchanged, no edits"`) to upload-and-host the
     photo — the response URL is a permanent BlockRun CDN URL we can pass
     to `blockrun_video.image_url`. Cost ≈ $0.06 extra.
  4. Alternatively, instruct the user to upload to a host they control and
     supply the URL.

### Step 3 — Prepare prompt

Use the master template from the **Dance style variants** section at the
bottom of this file. Pick the block matching `{style}` (default
`tiktok-trend`) and substitute its slots into the master template. For
`freestyle-from-music`, splice the user's `--music` argument into
`{user_music_description}`.

### Step 4 — Call BlockRun MCP (the slow one)

```
Tool: mcp__blockrun__blockrun_video
Arguments:
{
  "prompt": "<filled template from Step 3>",
  "image_url": "<URL from Step 2>",
  "duration_seconds": <int, default 5>,
  "model": "bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast"
}
```

Tell the user before calling:
> "Submitting to Seedance 2.0-fast. This blocks for 60–180s while polling.
> Sit tight."

The MCP tool handles all polling internally with a 300s hard cap. When
the call returns, expect either:
- Success: `response.structuredContent.url` is a permanent mp4 URL.
- Timeout (`did not complete within 300s`): no charge — offer a retry.

### Step 5 — Download mp4 and render GIF

1. Timestamp: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H%M%SZ"`.
2. Output dir: `${BLOCKRUN_OUT_DIR:-./blockrun-out}/{ts}-dance/`.
3. `mkdir -p` the dir.
4. `curl -sSL "<url>" -o <out_dir>/dance.mp4`.
5. Render shareable looping GIF (best-effort — skip if `ffmpeg` is missing):
   ```
   ffmpeg -i <out_dir>/dance.mp4 \
     -vf "fps=15,scale=540:-1:flags=lanczos,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" \
     -loop 0 <out_dir>/dance.gif
   ```
   If `ffmpeg` is not installed, omit the GIF and tell the user
   `brew install ffmpeg` would unlock it.
6. Confirm files are non-empty (`ls -la`).

### Step 6 — Report to user

```
✅ Dance video ready

  Video:    {relative path to .mp4}
  GIF:      {relative path to .gif}   (if rendered)
  Style:    {style}
  Duration: {duration} s
  Model:    bytedance/seedance-2.0-fast
  Cost:     ~${0.15 × duration} (settled on Base via x402)

Play it: open {relative path to .mp4}
```

If a GIF was generated, suggest the user attach it to a social post.

## Failure handling

| Error pattern | Action |
|---|---|
| `payment` / `balance` keywords | Show top-up message, do NOT retry. |
| `did not complete within 300s` | Tell the user the upstream was slow but no charge was taken; offer to retry. |
| `content filter` / `safety` / `invalid` | Apply the relevant retry addendum from the **Common Seedance pitfalls** section below (identity drift, hand warping, etc.) and retry once. |
| `image_url unreachable` / `unable to fetch source image` | Use the upload-via-blockrun_image fallback in Step 2 to host the local file, then retry. |
| `No wallet found` | Run `blockrun_wallet action: setup`, then retry. |

## Cost

| Duration | Cost |
|---|---|
| 5s (default) | ~$0.75 |
| 8s | ~$1.20 |
| 10s (max) | ~$1.50 |

Plus a one-time ~$0.06 if we used the upload-via-blockrun_image fallback.
Settled on Base USDC via x402. No charge if Seedance times out or fails.

## Examples

```
/dance ./me.jpg
/dance ./me.jpg --style hiphop
/dance ./me.jpg --style terracotta-disco
/dance ./me.jpg --style freestyle-from-music --music "lo-fi jazz 75 bpm"
/dance ./me.jpg --duration_seconds 8 --style kpop
```

## Master template (Seedance 2.0-fast, image-to-video)

```
The person from the input image performs {style} dance choreography.
Full body remains visible throughout. Smooth, fluid motion synchronized to
an implied {bpm} BPM beat. Camera: {camera_motion}. Setting:
{environment}. Lighting: {lighting}. The person's facial identity, body
proportions, hairstyle, and clothing remain consistent across every frame.

Avoid: extra limbs, identity drift, hands distorting, motion blur on face,
wardrobe morphing mid-shot.
```

## Dance style variants

Pick one by `--style` (or ask). Each block fills the master template's
variables.

### `hiphop` (urban + crisp pops)

```
{style}: crisp street hip-hop — chest pops, body rolls, shoulder isolations,
         a confident two-step groove with clean weight transfers
{bpm}: 95
{camera_motion}: slow circular dolly around subject, ending with a gentle
                 push-in on the final pose
{environment}: neon-lit urban underpass with subtle rain reflections OR
               graffiti-tagged warehouse interior
{lighting}: cyan + magenta neon spill, hard rim light from behind
```

### `ballet` (graceful, classical)

```
{style}: classical ballet — a single grand jeté leading into a piqué turn
         and finishing in fourth position arabesque
{bpm}: 60
{camera_motion}: smooth slow-mo tracking shot, low angle that sweeps to eye
                 level on the final pose
{environment}: bright minimalist dance studio with floor-to-ceiling windows
               OR a gilded baroque theater stage with red velvet drapes
{lighting}: soft natural daylight from camera-left OR warm theatrical key
            with a faint backlight
```

### `contemporary` (emotional, expressive)

```
{style}: contemporary modern — flowing arm extensions, a controlled fall to
         the floor, then a slow rebound rise; focus on emotional fluidity
{bpm}: 70
{camera_motion}: handheld-but-stable, drifts in and out subtly
{environment}: empty industrial loft with shafts of dust-lit light OR a
               minimalist concrete plaza at golden hour
{lighting}: single hard key from a high window, deep falloff to shadow
```

### `kpop` (synchronized, idol-stage energy)

```
{style}: K-pop idol-style point choreography — sharp arm hits, hair flips,
         crisp footwork, a charismatic finishing pose facing camera
{bpm}: 120
{camera_motion}: dynamic — quick zoom on the final beat, slight whip-pan
                 mid-routine
{environment}: glossy black-mirror stage with LED panel walls flashing
               brand colors
{lighting}: stage spots, strobing accent lights, lens flares on hits
```

### `terracotta-disco` (兵马俑迪斯科 — viral meme combo)

```
{style}: Tang Dynasty terracotta warrior comes alive and dances disco —
         stiff-then-loose shoulder shimmies, retro point-and-pose moves, a
         signature hip drop
{bpm}: 110
{camera_motion}: slow orbit revealing the underground tomb opening up into
                 a 1970s disco
{environment}: terracotta army pit with disco ball descending from above,
               other warriors frozen mid-pose in the background
{lighting}: warm tungsten torches transitioning into rotating disco-ball
            sparkles + colored gels
```

### `tiktok-trend` (default — current viral choreography wedge)

```
{style}: a clean tight 5-second TikTok-style routine — two distinct
         8-counts of upper-body choreography with one signature move on
         the final beat that begs to be looped
{bpm}: 105
{camera_motion}: locked tripod, vertical 9:16-friendly framing
{environment}: a bright bedroom OR minimalist white wall (let the camera
               feel native to the platform)
{lighting}: soft front ring-light look, natural skin tones, slight peach
            warmth
```

### `freestyle-from-music` (when the user provides a music description)

```
{style}: choreography that responds to the following music: {user_music_description}
{bpm}: {inferred_or_user_supplied}
{camera_motion}: matched to musical phrasing — calm during verses, dynamic
                 on hits
{environment}: chosen to match the music's mood (let the model interpret)
{lighting}: matched to mood
```

## Common Seedance pitfalls + retry addenda

### Identity drift (face changes mid-clip)

Append:
```
The person's face is locked to the source image. Do not interpret or
restyle the face. Lip movement, eye direction, and head orientation may
change naturally, but underlying facial structure and skin tone must be
identical to the source frame.
```

### Hands warping into 6+ fingers

Append:
```
Render hands clearly with five fingers each at all times. If a hand passes
behind the body, it should reappear with anatomically correct fingers.
```

### Wardrobe morphing

Append:
```
Clothing remains identical to the source frame for the entire 5 seconds:
same garment type, same color, same fit. Do not introduce accessories or
patterns not present in the source.
```

### "Static feeling" (low motion energy)

Append:
```
Increase motion energy. Limbs should travel through clear arcs, the upper
body should rotate, weight should shift visibly between feet at least
twice in 5 seconds.
```
