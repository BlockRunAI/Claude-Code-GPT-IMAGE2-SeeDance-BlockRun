## Original prompt

15s
Extend @video1 by 15 seconds. 1-5 seconds: Light and shadow pass slowly through venetian blinds onto the wooden table and cup. Tree branches sway gently with subtle breathing motion. 6-10 seconds: A coffee bean gently drifts down from the top of the frame. Camera pushes toward the coffee bean until the frame goes black. 11-15 seconds: English text gradually appears. First line "Lucky Coffee," second line "Breakfast," third line "AM 7:00-10:00."
